# ResponseBot
The Responsebot allows me to give my discord auth key and send messages to people without having to open discord while only using python
The goal of this bot was to create automated responses to people who message the user and send an automated message saying that the user they are trying to contact now is unavaliable, 
or to blacklist people from talking to you by sending a message that says the person you're trying to contact now is unavaliable so you don't have to worry about responding to them 
*Currently the bot can only send messages but it's unable to detect if a message has been sent to the user*

# pytube
Allows the user to download any youtube video just by providindg the link of the video, and a save location

# Email Spam Bot

This bot allows the user to send emails without having to open the app itself.
Can be updated to send the same email multiple times a day
